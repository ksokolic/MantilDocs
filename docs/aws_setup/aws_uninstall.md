# Uninstall

Uninstall command `mantil aws uninstall` will clean up all created resources and leave the AWS account in the initial state.
At this step, you will need to provide your AWS credentials again. There are three possible ways to do so that are already described in the node setup. 

After the uninstall, your account is in its original state. Mantil will remove anything it created.
