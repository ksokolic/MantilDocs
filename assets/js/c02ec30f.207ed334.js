That is especially convenient into Visual Studio or some other specialized IDE. The developers who are used to that kind of environments will feel unpleasant in any tool which doesn't support debug/breakpoint. I had the same feeling early in my career. After .Net I was developing in Ruby, Erlang, Go. In each of that environments I tried to setup some kind of breakpoint development style. That was short episodes and no one really useful. But I was not missing breakpoints. Breakpoint development is essentially a way to understand what is happening in the code. Once you have that mental model and can read code without need to fire debugger and go step by step you don't need it any more. Most of the experienced developers I know are asking for the breakpoint development style from the habit and from feeling insecure without it.",(0,r.kt)("br",{parentName:"p"}),"\n","Usually answer is that you don't need breakpoints just put some log lines to understand what is happening.
